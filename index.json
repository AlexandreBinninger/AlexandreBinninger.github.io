I currently work at IGL (Interactive Geometry Lab) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Olga Sorkine-Hornung. Formerly, I obtained a M.Sc. in Computer Science at ETH within the scope of the Ingénieur Polytechnicien Program (X2016). My research interest spans over shape modeling, digital representations of shapes and geometry processing techniques.\nMy general interests cover a large area. I am particularly excited about science in general, and especially about mathematical theories of any kind. I am also fond of general philosophy and history of ideas. Video games took up an essential part of my life: I keep track of their evolution from the point of view of game design and graphics. Finally, I am fond of learning languages: Bonjour, Hello, Guten Tag, 你好, こんにちは.\n Download my resumé. --- ","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"045660051edf7dba6c1789def472c8be","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am Alexandre Binninger, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science.
